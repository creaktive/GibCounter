GibCounter QuakeForge player rating
===================================

Copyright (C) 2003  Stanislaw Y. Pusep


Tiny Perl application that parses QuakeForge QuakeWorld fraglog files,
generates human-readable global & per-player statistics and write'em out in
HTML format. Supports graphical percentage bars, frag-per-death ratios and
colored "fun nicknames". Appearence of any element of generated stats can be
easily changed through CSS include file.

Easiest way to enable fraglogging is to run your
QuakeForge QuakeWorld server as follows:

qw-server +set fraglogfile 1

You can also edit .cfg files to enable this option.

*NOTE*: All stats coming from unpersonified players like "unnamed" or
"user-#" are redirected to /dev/null to avoid useless information bloat!

*WARNING*: this option works on QuakeForge QW builds _ONLY_, original iD QW
server doesn't supports such a feature so consider upgrading your server ;)


TODOs:
------

 * Make a converter from qw-server output to frag_#.log "\\\" format.
