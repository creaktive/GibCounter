This program requires no installation, it runs from *ANY* directory
and requires no special things; only Perl which is default on most
UN*X systems.

By the way, here goes some tips if you want stats to be generated
automatically ;)

1) First of all, I suggest you to run qw-server as special user, not
   as you and NEVER as root! Beleive me, adding "quake" user & group
   will save you a lot of time & anger :D

2) As root, create HTML file readable by your HTTP server and writable
   by "quake" user:

# touch /var/www/html/quake_stats.html
# chown quake:quake /var/www/html/quake_stats.html
# chmod 644 /var/www/html/quake_stats.html

3) Copy gibcounter.css file to the same directory as stats HTML:

# cp gibcounter.css /var/www/html/

Make sure that server reads it!

# chmod 644 /var/www/html/gibcounter.css

4) Create a crontab for "quake" user:

# crontab -u quake -e

0,15,30,45 * * * * gibcounter.pl>/var/www/html/quake_stats.html 2>/dev/null

5) You're done, quake_stats.html will be refreshed every 15 minutes now :)


Happy fragging!
